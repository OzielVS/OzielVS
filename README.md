- 👋 Hi, I’m @OzielVS
- 👀 I’m interested in to train myself daily as a DevOps and a little Front-End
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on network infrastructure, continuous integration, containerization test analysis, and I'm interested in Front end.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with the most diverse communities of developers to share my knowledge and absorb as much as possible.
